  <li> Direction: based on the front set as 90 degree, turn right as positive, turn left as negative</li>
  <li> Front Distance: the distance between the car's current degree's front wall and the car</li>
  <li> Right Distance: the distance between the car's current degree's right 45 degree's wall and the car</li>
  <li> Left Distance: the distance between the car's current degree's left 45 degree's wall and the car</li>
